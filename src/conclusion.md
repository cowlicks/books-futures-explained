# Conclusion and exercises

Congratulations. Good job! If you got this far, you must have stayed with me
all the way. I hope you enjoyed the ride!

Remember that you can always leave feedback, suggest improvements or ask questions
in the [issue_tracker](https://github.com/cfsamson/books-futures-explained/issues) for this book.
I'll try my best to respond to each one of them.

I'll leave you with some suggestions for exercises if you want to explore a little further below.

Until next time!

## Reader exercises

So our implementation has taken some obvious shortcuts and could use some improvement.
Actually, digging into the code and trying things yourself is a good way to learn. Here are
some good exercises if you want to explore more:

### Avoid wrapping the whole `Reactor` in a mutex and pass it around

First of all, protecting the whole `Reactor` and passing it around is overkill. We're only
interested in synchronizing some parts of the information it contains. Try to refactor that
out and only synchronize access to what's really needed.

I'd encourage you to have a look at how async_std solves this with a global [runtime](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/blob/b446cd023084a157b8a531cff65b8df37750be58/src/rt/mod.rs#L15-L23) which includes the [reactor](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/blob/b446cd023084a157b8a531cff65b8df37750be58/src/rt/runtime.rs#L39-L70)
and [how tokio's rutime](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/19a87e090ed528001e0363a30f6165304a710d49/tokio/src/runtime/context.rs#L2-L12) solves the same
thing in a slightly different way to get some inspiration.

* Do you want to pass around a reference to this information using an `Arc`?
* Do you want to make a global `Reactor` so it can be accessed from anywhere?

### Building a better executor

Right now, we can only run one and one future only. Most runtimes have a `spawn`
function which let's you start off a future and `await` it later so you
can run multiple futures concurrently.

As I suggested in the start of this book, visiting [@stjepan'sblog series about implementing your own executors](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207092849/https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html)
is the place I would start and take it from there. You could further examine the source code of [smol - A small and fast async runtime](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol) which is a good project to learn from.

### Create a unique Id for each task

As we discussed at the end of the main example. What happens if the user pass in
the same Id for both events?

```rust, ignore
let future1 = Task::new(reactor.clone(), 1, 1);
let future2 = Task::new(reactor.clone(), 2, 1);
```

Right now, it will deadlock since our `poll` method thinks the first poll of
`future2` is `future1` getting polled again and swaps out the waker with the
one from `future2`. This waker never gets called since the task is never
registered.

It's probably a bad idea to expose the user to this behavior, so we
should have a unique Id for each task which we use internally. There are many ways to solve this. 
Below is two suggestions to get going:

1. Let the reactor have a `usize` which is incremented on every task creation
2. Use a crate like `Guid` to generate an unique Id for each task
